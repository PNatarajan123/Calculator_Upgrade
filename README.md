# Calculator_Upgrade

A Ha Points 5

A Ha Moment: When we were able to understand the concept of JFrames and JPanels.
Arnav- 4/5: I gave myself a 4/5 because I was able to study a decent amount of code regarding GUI's and learning how to implement it in my code. I docked myself a point because I was not actually able to implement the code that much in the calculator and make many edits to it. We started experimenting somewhat with BlueJ

14/15 was the score we gave ourselves. The reason for us giving ourselves this score is that we were not able to work on effectively making many changes to the calculator.
